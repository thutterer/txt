# txt

This is my text scratchpad. I use it to draft text messages or write down ideas and tasks before they slip my mind.

There are no distractions and you can immediately start writing.

It does save its state to localStorage, but you shouldn't rely on that.
If you want to save and collect documents, use a proper editor and storage!
